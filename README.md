I built an app in react that toggles on and off. When toggled the component emits and event. The Component also supports being enabled and disabled and are visually styled to show these states.

## Optimizations

I would add some animation to improve this project to make it a bit more accessible. Adding a hover effect and focus state would make the components more visually appealing. I could also implement some testing to improve.
## Lessons Learned:
I generally build with CSS, so I struggled with Bootstrap for a moment. Once I got all of the scripts correct, it was relatively simple and easy to use.
